## Week 3 Independent Project by Dean Scelza @ Epicodus, 8-19-16 ##

### Please check out my work on gh-pages: https://d34n5.github.io/ping-pong

## Description & Technologies Used
This webpage takes a user-provided integer and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the provided number, but with the following exceptions: Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with pings, numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with pongs, and numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with ping-pong.
